# Agent Configuration

## Project Setup
- **Repository**: GitHub (Redamzi/saasportal)
- **Main Branch**: `main`
- **Deployment**: Coolify on Hetzner
- **Architecture**: Frontend (React/Vite) + Backend (Python/FastAPI)

## Deployment Workflow
See `workflows/deployment.md` for the standard deployment process.

## Key Points
- Always push to GitHub before deploying
- Use Coolify for deployments (no local-only work)
- Frontend and Backend are deployed separately
